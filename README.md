# js-consoleQuiz
A simple quiz game built for the browsers console. The browser will prompt the user to answer the questions displayed in the console. As the player answer correctly, he/she gains points. This was built to develop a deeper understanding of function constructors. When running this code, make certain that chome dev tools are open first and switch to the console window.

Note: There is a promise warning that will display on exit. This doesn't appear to affect the game in any adverse way. An update will be issued if a fix can be determined.
